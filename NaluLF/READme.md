# 🌊 NaluXRP — Self-Custodied XRPL Wallet & Analytics Platform

> A real-time XRPL ledger explorer, deep account inspector, encrypted self-custody wallet,
> and portfolio analytics platform. Runs entirely client-side — no backend, no server,
> no custody. Deployable as a PWA or native iOS app via Capacitor + TestFlight.

---

## What Is NaluXRP?

NaluXRP is a full-featured XRPL dashboard that connects **directly to XRPL nodes via WebSocket**. No backend required — everything runs client-side in the browser or as a native iOS app. Your encrypted vault lives only on your device and only you hold the key.

Built for XRPL power users who want deep portfolio analytics, multi-wallet management, NFT tracking, DEX order monitoring, real-time ledger streaming, and on-chain fraud detection — all without ever trusting a third party with their keys or data.

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Zero Server Storage** | Vault, keys, and profile data never leave your browser |
| **You Own Your Keys** | Seeds encrypted with AES-256-GCM before written to localStorage |
| **Direct Network Access** | Connects directly to XRPL validators — no proxy, no API middleman |
| **Offline-Capable Design** | Core wallet functions work without a persistent connection |
| **Open & Auditable** | No obfuscated backend — everything runs in your browser and can be inspected |

## Feature Overview

### 🔐 Authentication & Vault
- **AES-256-GCM** encrypted vault with **PBKDF2 (150,000 iterations)** key derivation
- 3-step account creation: Identity → Security → Sync Awareness
- Domain / `@handle` registration alongside display name and email
- Auto-lock after 30 minutes of inactivity with dismissible lock banner
- Vault export / backup to `.json` file
- Cross-device sync via encrypted vault code (paste code or load backup file)
- Canvas-based CAPTCHA on registration
- Password strength meter with real-time scoring

### 💎 Multi-Wallet Management
- **Generate new wallets** — Ed25519 or secp256k1, entirely in-browser
- **Import from seed** — family seed or hex seed, encrypted before storage
- **Watch-only wallets** — track any XRPL address without a seed (`👁 Watch-only` badge)
- Per-wallet balance with **reserve breakdown** (base 10 XRP + owner count × 2 XRP)
- Available vs. reserved balance shown separately on every card
- Clickable token chips per wallet → Token Details modal with issuer, limit, DEX link
- One-click address copy with visual confirmation

### 📊 Portfolio Analytics
- Total portfolio value in XRP and estimated USD (live CoinGecko feed)
- **Balance history sparklines** — snapshots stored per address automatically
- **26-week on-chain activity heatmap** (GitHub-style calendar)
- **Transaction type breakdown** bar chart
- **XRP flow analysis** — inflow, outflow, net across all wallets
- **Token allocation bars** — visual breakdown of trustline holdings
- **Benford's Law fraud detection** — mathematical anomaly analysis of transaction amounts

### 🔍 XRPL Account Inspector
- Deep-dive any XRPL address, transaction hash, or ledger object
- **Security Audit** — master key, regular key age, account flags, signer list
- **Drain Risk Analysis** — 4-level drain classification (Low → Critical)
- **NFT Analysis** — free sell offers, no-URI mints, burn patterns, transfer fees
- **Wash Trading Detection** — 5-signal scoring: cancel ratio, round-trips, pair concentration, burst activity, fill rate
- **Token Issuer Analysis** — obligations, freeze state, black hole detection
- **AMM & Liquidity** — LP positions, fee votes, auction bids
- **Risk Score (0–100)** — composite score with color bands (green / amber / orange / red)
- Recent inspection history (last 8 addresses with saved risk scores)

### ⚡ Live Ledger Stream
- Real-time ledger log — every new ledger and transaction as it closes (~3–4 seconds)
- TPS, average fee, success rate, dominant TX type metric cards
- TX Mix chart — live breakdown of transaction types in current session
- Fee pressure bar: Low → Normal → Elevated → High → Congested

### 🌐 Network Monitor
- Latency probe across all XRPL endpoints
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (max 30s)
- Endpoint cycling on failure (s1 → s2 → xrplcluster → xrpl.ws)
- Switch between Mainnet, Testnet, and Xahau

### ⌨️ Command Palette
- `⌘K` / `/` keyboard shortcut
- Search wallets, navigate sections, trigger actions, inspect any address

### 🎨 Profile & Identity
- Display name + `@handle` + `.xrpl` domain chip in profile header
- Avatar: uploaded image, linked NFT, or DID reference
- Banner image with gradient presets
- Metrics row: Total XRP · Est. USD · Transactions · Wallet Age · Tokens · Reserved XRP
- Social links (Twitter/X, GitHub, Discord, etc.) with verified badges
- Activity log with 26-week heatmap
- Public profile preview mode

## Security Model

```
Your Password
     │
     ▼
PBKDF2 (SHA-256 · 150,000 iterations · 32-byte random salt)
     │
     ▼
AES-256-GCM Key  (non-exportable CryptoKey — never persisted)
     │
     ▼
Encrypt(vault JSON)  ──►  localStorage["naluxrp_vault_data"]
                                        (ciphertext + IV only)
```

- **Salt** — unique per account, stored separately in `naluxrp_vault_meta`
- **IV** — unique per save operation (fresh 12-byte random value each write)
- **Key** — exists only in RAM during an active session, never written to disk
- **Auto-lock** — clears key from memory after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **No key material** — never transmitted over the network under any circumstance

See [WHITEPAPER.md](WHITEPAPER.md) for the full cryptographic specification.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/naluxrp.git
cd naluxrp

# No build step required — pure ES modules
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

> Must be served over `http://localhost` or `https://` — the Web Crypto API requires a secure context.

---

## Building for iOS (TestFlight)

NaluXRP is fully prepared for Capacitor.

### 1. Install Capacitor

```bash
npm init -y
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli @capacitor/ios
npx cap init NaluXRP com.yourorg.naluxrp --web-dir .
```

### 2. `capacitor.config.json`

```json
{
  "appId": "com.yourorg.naluxrp",
  "appName": "NaluXRP",
  "webDir": ".",
  "server": { "androidScheme": "https" },
  "ios": {
    "contentInset": "always",
    "scrollEnabled": false,
    "backgroundColor": "#080f1e"
  },
  "plugins": {
    "SplashScreen": {
      "launchShowDuration": 1500,
      "backgroundColor": "#080f1e",
      "spinnerColor": "#00fff0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Build & submit

```bash
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
```

In Xcode: set Team → Bundle ID → Deployment Target iOS 15.0+ → Archive → Distribute → TestFlight.

Add to `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict><key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key><true/></dict>
<key>UIStatusBarStyle</key>
<string>UIStatusBarStyleLightContent</string>
```

### PWA Install (without TestFlight)

In Safari on iPhone: **Share → Add to Home Screen**. Launches full-screen like a native app.
